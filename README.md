# Fall-2021-Minigames
Hey everyone! Welcome to our Fall 2021 project!

To get started, you'll want to clone the master branch, but all work afterwards should be done in a separate branch for each minigame. We generally won't be merging branches until a minigame is functional, just to keep things clean. As a matter of Git compatibility, try not to edit the main menu scene unless you're actively working on it (so basically if you're making a minigame, don't touch the menu, because someone else will probably do that for you). Finally, in order to complete a pull request to master, you'll notice that you need someone to review it for you (assuming I set Github up correctly).

Looking forward to working with you all!

10,HALT!
10,"Who dare trespass upon my forest? Strangers, identify yourself!"
0,Uh... My name is Lex.
2,Hi! I'm Bean!
10,"Ah, young ones. And you, Curer... I see you're back too."
10,"Trying to convince me to off myself again, huh?"
9,Dear Root--
10,Have I not made myself clear?
10,We have discussed this over tea and amidst firestorms...
10,Why can you not understand? I can't let this life go.
0,What do you mean you can't?
2,Tell us! Let us help!
10,You think I like feeling like this?
10,"I guard the sacred life force of this world, and it kills me––"
10,"It kills me knowing that my misery, my own roots, are sapping this realm of its beauty..."
10,But I can not move on.
0,Why not? You're clearly miserable.
10,"Young little grasshopper, you don't understand."
10,"My granddaughter, Alona..."
9,"You can't leave little Alona to live on her own, can you?"
10,"Yes, yes..."
10,"Because, who is going to look after her when I'm gone...?"
10,You don't understand what it's like to live as if your heart...
10,...as if...
9,As if it's beating outside of your body?
9,"Believe me, I understand."
9,When I lost Bean... it felt... a part of me was gone.
2,Oh mom... I'm here now!
9,"Oh my dear Beanie, yes you are! And to see you again after you've grown so much!"
9,"Devastated as I was to have lost you, I can't help but feel proud of all that you've become."
2,"Mom, I missed you so much too!"
2,"Also, can you give me a belly rub when we get home...?"
9,"Oh, you silly goose. Of course, darling."
0,AHEM. Speaking of little Alona...
0,"Mr. Root, sir."
2,"We have something for you, from Alona."

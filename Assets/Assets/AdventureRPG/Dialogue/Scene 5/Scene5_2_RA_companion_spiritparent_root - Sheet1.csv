0,My dearest grandpa Root--
0,I know we usually meet every full moon to talk about our blossoms and the latest birdsongs over tea.
0,"But lately, the drought is so terrible that I'm very scared to visit you..."
0,I know that you are doing this because you want to live longer and take care of me.
0,Because you love me.
0,"Grandpa, I love you too."
0,But it's hard to see you like this now.
0,I hope I can visit you again...
0,when your branches provide stages for birds to sing...
0,and when you provide spirits to cool under your shades.
0,"Love, Alona"
10,...
10,"You know, Alona used to hate being alone..."
10,But now she's so grown up that she doesn't need me to act as she pleases...
10,Oh how miserable and old I feel compared to her!
10,And what a fine spirit Alona has become!
10,...
10,Curer.
9,"Yes, dear Root."
10,I'm ready to be cured.

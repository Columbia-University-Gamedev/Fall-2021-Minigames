1,Alexis!
0,"Um...Hello, have we met before...?"
1,"Aha, I forgot that it's the first time we meet in human form!"
0,Professor X?
1,Indeed.
0,You've unMetamorphosed back into human!
1,It seems that the amount of pollen flowing into our Human Realm has drastically decreased in this past couple of hours.
1,"As a result, all our Metamorphosed colleagues are slowly transforming back into our original selves."
1,"Though I do miss those flapping wings, to be quite honest."
1,"Anyway, who do I see here? Our dear Curer!"
9,It's been awhile Hatter. It's fortunate and unfortunate that I couldn't see you in spirit form.
1,We can't always have the best of both worlds...
1,"Speaking of, we should probably head back to our lab to write up a report on all of this, Alexis."
0,Right!
0,...
0,"Wait professor, I thought we could only use the portal twice..."
0,"And you are here, which means..."
1,"HA. So you most certainly did NOT do the readings, have you?"
1,The two-times limit on portal usage is utter humbug! Hogwash! Gobbledygook!
1,"The two-usage ""setting"" was to make sure you accomplish the tasks."
0,...
1,"Well it wasn't much of a choice not to send you to Alstroemeria even if you hadn't read, since everyone else qualified were Metamorphosized."
1,"But I saw that your desire to help the world was sincere, and I believed that you could do it. "
1,So thank you.
1,"Now let's head to the portal, so we can get back home."

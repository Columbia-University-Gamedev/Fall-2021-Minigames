2,Mom!!!
9,Bean! Why are you back here? Didn't I send you away?
2,"I was worried for you! Come on, we need to leave before the drought mutates you!"
9,"Darling, it's my job as the Curer to stay here and help those who transformed. "
0,Oh! So you're Bean's mom AND the Curer! What a coincidence!
9,"Who is she, darling?"
2,"She's Lex! She's a human, mom! She helped me find you!"
9,"My my, what great act of kindness! Thank you Lex, for looking after my child."
0,"Of course, it was great pleasure to travel with Bean."
9,"What brings you here? Are you too, lost, and need to find your way back to the Human Realm?"
0,"Well, I came to Alstroemeria to find you, actually."
0,The pollen spewed by the mutated spirits are flowing into our realm and transforming humans into spirits.
0,We need your help to transform our people back into humans. 
9,"Oh my, that is a very serious problem! "
2,"Mom, can we help them?"
9,"Yes, Bean."
9,"But mutations become harder to cure as time passes, so we need to go help your people immediately."
0,"But before we go back, we need to meet with the Root."
9,The Root?
9,That might be...difficult. He hasn't spoken to anyone for days now.
9,"I have been trying to cure the Root to stop the drought, which is causing all these troublesome mutations."
9,He refuses to let go of his natural expectancy and continues to drain the life force of our realm. 
9,"I cannot convince him otherwise, and without his own will, it is beyond my capabilities to cure him."
2,Maybe this letter can help!
9,A letter? To the Root?
0,We were entrusted to give this letter to the Root by Alona.
9,His granddaughter?
9,"If we can cure the Root, that would stop all the mutations once and for all."
9,But I'm still not sure if you'll have much success.
9,I think it's better and more certain to hurry back and help your people instead.

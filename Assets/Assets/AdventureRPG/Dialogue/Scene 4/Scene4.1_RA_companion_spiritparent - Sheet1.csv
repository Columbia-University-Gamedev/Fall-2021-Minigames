2,"Mom, you should go."
9,"Bean, no. How are you going to live on your own? Who's going to look after Alstroemeria?"
2,"But you're the only one who can help humans, mom. "
2,Don't worry about Alstroemeria. I got a lot of practice curing and helping other spirits.
9,...You learned to cure?
2,"Yeah! I can help mutated spirits in Alstroemeria, and one day, maybe I can help the Root too!"
2,"After all, it's your job as the Curer to help those who transformed, right mom? "

9,"You've bloomed into a wonderful spirit, I am so proud of you, Bean."
9,...I shall entrust the role of the Curer of Alstroemeria to you. 
9,"Lex, I'm ready to help your fellow humans, take me to the portal."

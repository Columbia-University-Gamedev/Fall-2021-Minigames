2,"Is he really a meanie, like everyone says? I'm a bit scared to meet him."
8,"He's a difficult one to deal with, that's for sure."
8, He's been even worse since little Alona went missing. 
8,"But he used to be a caring, nice tree spirit. The life of the forest, even."

2,"Psst, hey Lex, isn't she the one that gave us the letter?"

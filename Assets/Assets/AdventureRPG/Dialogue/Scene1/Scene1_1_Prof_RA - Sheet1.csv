0,Hello? Professor X?
0,...Hello? Is anyone here?
1,There you are! You must be Y. I've been waiting for you all day.
0,Professor X? Where are you? I don't see you.
1,Down here! 
0,Professor?? Is that you...?
1,"Unfortunately, yes."
0,When we spoke on the phone I had no idea you were--I mean--
1,"I scared off a couple of grad students when I did an in person interview, so I learned to conduct it via phone. Trial and error! "
0,...
1,"I don't look that bad in my transformed version of my body, do I?"
0,"Transformed? I mean, yes of course you look great, you rock those little wings, but...you used to be human?"
1,"Yes, obviously, Y. You didn't think I discovered the cure for cancer as a spirit, did you? "
0,Spirit? Is that what you are now? Humans can become spirits?
1,"Well, under normal circumstances, no. That's exactly our problem."
1,I've come down with a terrible disease. The disease of...Metamorphosis. 
0,And this disease transformed your body into a spirit?
1,"Yes, but that's not our biggest problem."
0,It's not?
1,"You see, Metamorphosis isn't just affecting me..."
0,What? Other people are being transformed?
1,Glad we're on the same page.
0,"Well, I haven't noticed spirits floating around campus. "
1,It's been happening at a slow rate so far. That's good. That means there's still time to stop it and reverse the damage.
1,Perhaps the mutated pollen is spilling out to our realm causing the Metamorphosis...
1,But I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me give you a tour first. Then we can talk specifics.

1,"You've always been exceptional, Curer. I had no doubt in your capabiliites!"
1,"Curer, thank you! We would all be permanently transformed into fluffy winged spirits if it weren't for you."
0,Professor Hatter...is there any way you could rebuild the portal to the Spirit Realm?

1,...
1,...Is that so?

9,"I knew what I was getting into, and Bean and I chose to help you humans."
1,"I'm very sorry. The portal is twice usage, and it takes years to build one."
1,That's why my expeditions and research on Alstroemeria had been few and sparse.
1,"But I will give my all to recreate the portal as soon as possible, Curer."
9,"Thank you, Hatter."

1,Most certainly! You are at the exact place for that.
9,Then I think I would work alongside you in this laboratory until I can meet my Bean again.

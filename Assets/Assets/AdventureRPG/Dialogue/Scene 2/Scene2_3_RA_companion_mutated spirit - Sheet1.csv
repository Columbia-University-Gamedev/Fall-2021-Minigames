2,"That's a mutated spirit! Poor thing, he's spewing out pollen. "
0,"Ohh, so that's the pollen Professor Hatter mentioned."
2,It's all because of the weird weather in Heartland! My mom said something about a drought causing the mutations... 
2,"For us, the pollen only causes an itchy eye, sneezing, shortness of breath, and fishy breath."
2,But mom told me that humans can only get exposed to the pollen 3 times before turning into a spirit!
2,So we should probably avoid him...

2,"I mean, I hypothetically might be able to cure him..."
2,"But I suck at curing, and you might turn into a spirit too!"
0,"We can try avoiding the pollen, and if we can help, we should at least try, right?"
